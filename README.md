## Data Importation and Exploration

● Start a spark session and load the stock file while inferring the data types.

● Determine the column names

● Make observations about the schema.

● Show the first 5 rows

● Use the describe method to learn about the data frame

## Data Preparation

● Format all the data to 2 decimal places i.e. format_number()

● Create a new data frame with a column called HV Ratio that is the ratio of the High Price versus volume of stock traded for a day

## Data Analysis

● What day had the Peak High in Price?

● What is the mean of the Close column?

● What is the max and min of the Volume column?

● How many days was the Close lower than 60 dollars?

● What percentage of the time was the High greater than 80 dollars?
